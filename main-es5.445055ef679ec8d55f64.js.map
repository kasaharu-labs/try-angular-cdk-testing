It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to Observable's constructor, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what will be emitted by an Observable, and when it be will emitted. This means\n   * that calling `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * the thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * of the following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, if the `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where the first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, the second of an `error` method and the third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whichever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop the work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n   * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable\n   * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a `scheduler`.\n   *\n   * ## Example\n   * ### Subscribe with an Observer\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const sumObserver = {\n   *   sum: 0,\n   *   next(value) {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     this.sum = this.sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   error() {\n   *     // We actually could just remove this method,\n   *     // since we do not really care about errors right now.\n   *   },\n   *   complete() {\n   *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);\n   *   }\n   * };\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.\n   *   .subscribe(sumObserver);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Subscribe with functions\n   * ```ts\n   * import { of } from 'rxjs'\n   *\n   * let sum = 0;\n   *\n   * of(1, 2, 3).subscribe(\n   *   value => {\n   *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);\n   *     sum = sum + value;\n   *   },\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum)\n   * );\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // \"Adding: 1\"\n   * // \"Adding: 2\"\n   * // \"Adding: 3\"\n   * // \"Sum equals: 6\"\n   * ```\n   *\n   * ### Cancel a subscription\n   * ```ts\n   * import { interval } from 'rxjs';\n   *\n   * const subscription = interval(1000).subscribe(\n   *   num => console.log(num),\n   *   undefined,\n   *   () => {\n   *     // Will not be called, even when cancelling subscription.\n   *     console.log('completed!');\n   *   }\n   * );\n   *\n   * setTimeout(() => {\n   *   subscription.unsubscribe();\n   *   console.log('unsubscribed!');\n   * }, 2500);\n   *\n   * // Logs:\n   * // 0 after 1s\n   * // 1 after 2s\n   * // \"unsubscribed!\" after 2.5s\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param {Observer|Function} observerOrNext (optional) Either an observer with methods to be called,\n   *  or the first of three possible handlers, which is the handler for each value emitted from the subscribed\n   *  Observable.\n   * @param {Function} error (optional) A handler for a terminal event resulting from an error.

This means that the\n * resolution function when looking for a value needs to first look at the binding value, and than\n * at `TStylingKey` (if it exists).\n *\n * Imagine we have:\n *\n * ```\n * <div class=\"TEMPLATE\" my-dir>\n *\n * @Directive({\n *   host: {\n *     class: 'DIR',\n *     '[class.dynamic]': 'exp' // ÉµÉµclassProp('dynamic', ctx.exp);\n *   }\n * })\n * ```\n *\n * In the above case the linked list will contain one item:\n *\n * ```\n *   // assume binding location: 10 for `ÉµÉµclassProp('dynamic', ctx.exp);`\n *   tData[10] = <TStylingStatic>[\n *     '': 'dynamic', // This is the wrapped value of `TStylingKey`\n *     'DIR': true,   // This is the default static value of directive binding.\n *   ];\n *   tData[10 + 1] = 0; // We don't have prev/next.\n *\n *   lView[10] = undefined;     // assume `ctx.exp` is `undefined`\n *   lView[10 + 1] = undefined; // Just normalized `lView[10]`\n * ```\n *\n * So when the function is resolving styling value, it first needs to look into the linked list\n * (there is none) and than into the static `TStylingStatic` too see if there is a default value for\n * `dynamic` (there is not). Therefore it is safe to remove it.\n *\n * If setting `true` case:\n * ```\n *   lView[10] = true;     // assume `ctx.exp` is `true`\n *   lView[10 + 1] = true; // Just normalized `lView[10]`\n * ```\n * So when the function is resolving styling value, it first needs to look into the linked list\n * (there is none) and than into `TNode.residualClass` (TNode.residualStyle) which contains\n * ```\n *   tNode.residualClass = [\n *     'TEMPLATE': true,\n *   ];\n * ```\n *\n * This means that it is safe to add class.\n */\nexport interface TStylingStatic extends KeyValueArray<any> {}\n\n/**\n * This is a branded number which contains previous and next index.\n *\n * When we come across styling instructions we need to store the `TStylingKey` in the correct\n * order so that we can re-concatenate the styling value in the desired priority.\n *\n * The insertion can happen either at the:\n * - end of template as in the case of coming across additional styling instruction in the template\n * - in front of the template in the case of coming across additional instruction in the\n *   `hostBindings`.\n *\n * We use `TStylingRange` to store the previous and next index into the `TData` where the template\n * bindings can be found.\n *\n * - bit 0 is used to mark that the previous index has a duplicate for current value.\n * - bit 1 is used to mark that the next index has a duplicate for the current value.\n * - bits 2-16 are used to encode the next/tail of the template.\n * - bits 17-32 are used to encode the previous/head of template.\n *\n * NODE: *duplicate* false implies that it is statically known that this binding will not collide\n * with other bindings and therefore there is no need to check other bindings.

Unlike ngDoCheck, ngOnChanges and ngOnInit, which are\n// called during a pre-order traversal of the view tree (that is calling the\n// parent hooks before the child hooks) these events are sent in using a\n// post-order traversal of the tree (children before parents). This changes the\n// meaning of initIndex in the view state. For ngOnInit, initIndex tracks the\n// expected nodeIndex which a ngOnInit should be called. When sending\n// ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit it is the expected count of\n// ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit methods that have been called. This\n// ensure that despite being called recursively or after picking up after an\n// exception, the ngAfterContentInit or ngAfterViewInit will be called on the\n// correct nodes. Consider for example, the following (where E is an element\n// and D is a directive)\n//  Tree:       pre-order index  post-order index\n//    E1        0                6\n//      E2      1                1\n//       D3     2                0\n//      E4      3                5\n//       E5     4                4\n//        E6    5                2\n//        E7    6                3\n// As can be seen, the post-order index has an unclear relationship to the\n// pre-order index (postOrderIndex === preOrderIndex - parentCount +\n// childCount). Since number of calls to ngAfterContentInit and ngAfterViewInit\n// are stable (will be the same for the same view regardless of exceptions or\n// recursion) we just need to count them which will roughly correspond to the\n// post-order index (it skips elements and directives that do not have\n// lifecycle hooks).\n//\n// For example, if an exception is raised in the E6.onAfterViewInit() the\n// initIndex is left at 3 (by shouldCallLifecycleInitHook() which set it to\n// initIndex + 1). When checkAndUpdateView() is called again D3, E2 and E6 will\n// not have their ngAfterViewInit() called but, starting with E7, the rest of\n// the view will begin getting ngAfterViewInit() called until a check and\n// pass is complete.\n//\n// This algorthim also handles recursion. Consider if E4's ngAfterViewInit()\n// indirectly calls E1's ChangeDetectorRef.detectChanges(). The expected\n// initIndex is set to 6, the recusive checkAndUpdateView() starts walk again.\n// D3, E2, E6, E7, E5 and E4 are skipped, ngAfterViewInit() is called on E1.\n// When the recursion returns the initIndex will be 7 so E1 is skipped as it\n// has already been called in the recursively called checkAnUpdateView().\nexport function callLifecycleHooksChildrenFirst(view: ViewData, lifecycles: NodeFlags) {\n  if (!(view.def.nodeFlags & lifecycles)) {\n    return;\n  }\n  const nodes = view.def.nodes;\n  let initIndex = 0;\n  for (let i = 0; i < nodes.length; i++) {\n    const nodeDef = nodes[i];\n    let parent = nodeDef.parent;\n    if (!parent && nodeDef.flags & lifecycles) {\n      // matching root node (e.g. a pipe)\n      callProviderLifecycles(view, i, nodeDef.flags & lifecycles, initIndex++);\n    }\n    if ((nodeDef.childFlags & lifecycles) === 0) {\n      // no child matches one of the lifecycles\n      i += nodeDef.childCount;\n    }\n    while (parent && (parent.flags & NodeFlags.TypeElement) &&\n           i === parent.nodeIndex + parent.childCount) {\n      // last child of an element\n      if (parent.directChildFlags & lifecycles) {\n        initIndex = callElementProvidersLifecycles(view, parent, lifecycles, initIndex);\n      }\n      parent = parent.parent;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunction callElementProvidersLifecycles(\n    view: ViewData, elDef: NodeDef, lifecycles: NodeFlags, initIndex: number): number {\n  for (let i = elDef.nodeIndex + 1; i <= elDef.nodeIndex + elDef.childCount; i++) {\n    const nodeDef = view.def.nodes[i];\n    if (nodeDef.flags & lifecycles) {\n      callProviderLifecycles(view, i, nodeDef.flags & lifecycles, initIndex++);\n    }\n    // only visit direct children\n    i += nodeDef.childCount;\n  }\n  return initIndex;\n}\n\nfunction callProviderLifecycles(\n    view: ViewData, index: number, lifecycles: NodeFlags, initIndex: number) {\n  const providerData = asProviderData(view, index);\n  if (!providerData) {\n    return;\n  }\n  const provider = providerData.instance;\n  if (!provider) {\n    return;\n  }\n  Services.setCurrentNode(view, index);\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.AfterContentInit &&\n      shouldCallLifecycleInitHook(view, ViewState.InitState_CallingAfterContentInit, initIndex)) {\n    provider.ngAfterContentInit();\n  }\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.AfterContentChecked) {\n    provider.ngAfterContentChecked();\n  }\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.AfterViewInit &&\n      shouldCallLifecycleInitHook(view, ViewState.InitState_CallingAfterViewInit, initIndex)) {\n    provider.ngAfterViewInit();\n  }\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.AfterViewChecked) {\n    provider.ngAfterViewChecked();\n  }\n  if (lifecycles & NodeFlags.OnDestroy) {\n    provider.ngOnDestroy();\n  }\n}\n","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

asynchronous task when the application starts\n * (for example for a polling process, started with a `setInterval`, a `setTimeout`\n * or using RxJS operators like `interval`);\n * - the `isStable` Observable runs outside of the Angular zone.\n *\n * Let's imagine that you start a recurrent task\n * (here incrementing a counter, using RxJS `interval`),\n * and at the same time subscribe to `isStable`.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *      filter(stable => stable)\n *   ).subscribe(() => console.log('App is stable now');\n *   interval(1000).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));\n * }\n * ```\n * In this example, `isStable` will never emit `true`,\n * and the trace \"App is stable now\" will never get logged.\n *\n * If you want to execute something when the app is stable,\n * you have to wait for the application to be stable\n * before starting your polling process.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *     first(stable => stable),\n *     tap(stable => console.log('App is stable now')),\n *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))\n *   ).subscribe(counter => console.log(counter));\n * }\n * ```\n * In this example, the trace \"App is stable now\" will be logged\n * and then the counter starts incrementing every second.\n *\n * Note also that this Observable runs outside of the Angular zone,\n * which means that the code in the subscription\n * to this Observable will not trigger the change detection.\n *\n * Let's imagine that instead of logging the counter value,\n * you update a field of your component\n * and display it in its template.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *     first(stable => stable),\n *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))\n *   ).subscribe(counter => this.value = counter);\n * }\n * ```\n * As the `isStable` Observable runs outside the zone,\n * the `value` field will be updated properly,\n * but the template will not be refreshed!\n *\n * You'll have to manually trigger the change detection to update the template.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, cd: ChangeDetectorRef) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *     first(stable => stable),\n *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))\n *   ).subscribe(counter => {\n *     this.value = counter;\n *     cd.detectChanges();\n *   });\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Or make the subscription callback run inside the zone.\n *\n * ```\n * constructor(appRef: ApplicationRef, zone: NgZone) {\n *   appRef.isStable.pipe(\n *     first(stable => stable),\n *     switchMap(() => interval(1000))\n *   ).subscribe(counter => zone.run(() => this.value = counter));\n * }\n * ```\n *\n *

Useful when the expression is\n * more complex then a property access, for example when using the async pipe (`userStreams |\n * async`).\n * - `index: number`: The index of the current item in the iterable.\n * - `first: boolean`: True when the item is the first item in the iterable.\n * - `last: boolean`: True when the item is the last item in the iterable.\n * - `even: boolean`: True when the item has an even index in the iterable.\n * - `odd: boolean`: True when the item has an odd index in the iterable.\n *\n * ### Change propagation\n *\n * When the contents of the iterator changes, `NgForOf` makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:\n *\n * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.\n * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.\n * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.\n *\n * Angular uses object identity to track insertions and deletions within the iterator and reproduce\n * those changes in the DOM. This has important implications for animations and any stateful\n * controls that are present, such as `<input>` elements that accept user input. Inserted rows can\n * be animated in, deleted rows can be animated out, and unchanged rows retain any unsaved state\n * such as user input.\n * For more on animations, see [Transitions and Triggers](guide/transition-and-triggers).\n *\n * The identities of elements in the iterator can change while the data does not.\n * This can happen, for example, if the iterator is produced from an RPC to the server, and that\n * RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the second response produces objects with\n * different identities, and Angular must tear down the entire DOM and rebuild it (as if all old\n * elements were deleted and all new elements inserted).\n *\n * To avoid this expensive operation, you can customize the default tracking algorithm.\n * by supplying the `trackBy` option to `NgForOf`.\n * `trackBy` takes a function that has two arguments: `index` and `item`.\n * If `trackBy` is given, Angular tracks changes by the return value of the function.\n *\n * @see [Structural Directives](guide/structural-directives)\n * @ngModule CommonModule\n * @publicApi\n */\n@Directive({selector: '[ngFor][ngForOf]'})\nexport class NgForOf<T, U extends NgIterable<T> = NgIterable<T>> implements DoCheck {\n  /**\n   * The value of the iterable expression, which can be used as a\n   * [template input variable](guide/structural-directives#template-input-variable).\n   */\n  @Input()\n  set ngForOf(ngForOf: U&NgIterable<T>|undefined|null) {\n    this._ngForOf = ngForOf;\n    this._ngForOfDirty = true;\n  }\n  /**\n   * A function that defines how to track changes for items in the iterable.\n   *\n   * When items are added, moved, or removed in the iterable,\n   * the directive must re-render the appropriate DOM nodes.\n   * To minimize churn in the DOM, only nodes that have changed\n   * are re-rendered.\n   *\n   * By default, the change detector assumes that\n   * the object instance identifies the node in the iterable.\n   * When this function is supplied, the directive uses\n   * the result of calling this function to identify the item node,\n   * rather than the identity of the object itself.\n   *\n   * The function receives two inputs,\n   * the iteration index and the node object ID.\n   */\n  @Input()\n  set ngForTrackBy(fn: TrackByFunction<T>) {\n    if (isDevMode() && fn != null && typeof fn !== 'function') {\n      // TODO(vicb): use a log service once there is a public one available\n      if (<any>console && <any>console.warn) {\n        console.warn(\n            `trackBy must be a function, but received ${JSON.stringify(fn)}. ` +\n            `See https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf#change-propagation for more information.`);\n      }\n    }\n    this._trackByFn = fn;\n  }\n\n  get ngForTrackBy(): TrackByFunction<T> { return this._trackByFn; }\n\n  private _ngForOf: U|undefined|null = null;\n  private _ngForOfDirty: boolean = true;\n  private _differ: IterableDiffer<T>|null = null;\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  private _trackByFn !: TrackByFunction<T>;\n\n  constructor(\n      private _viewContainer: ViewContainerRef,\n      private _template: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T, U>>, private _differs: IterableDiffers) {}\n\n  /**\n   * A reference to the template that is stamped out for each item in the iterable.\n   * @see [template reference variable](guide/template-syntax#template-reference-variables--var-)\n   */\n  @Input()\n  set ngForTemplate(value: TemplateRef<NgForOfContext<T, U>>) {\n    // TODO(TS2.1): make TemplateRef<Partial<NgForRowOf<T>>> once we move to TS v2.1\n    // The current type is too restrictive; a template that just uses index, for example,\n    // should be acceptable.\n    if (value) {\n      this._template = value;\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * Applies the changes when needed.\n   */\n  ngDoCheck(): void {\n    if (this._ngForOfDirty) {\n      this._ngForOfDirty = false;\n      // React on ngForOf changes only once all inputs have been initialized\n      const value = this._ngForOf;\n      if (!this._differ && value) {\n        try {\n          this._differ = this._differs.find(value).create(this.ngForTrackBy);\n        } catch {\n          throw new Error(\n              `Cannot find a differ supporting object '${value}' of type '${getTypeName(value)}'.

You can also specify a template that is defined\n * externally, by referencing a labeled `<ng-template>` element. When you do this, you can\n * change which template to use at runtime, as shown in the following example.\n *\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfThenElse'}\n *\n * ### Storing a conditional result in a variable\n *\n * You might want to show a set of properties from the same object. If you are waiting\n * for asynchronous data, the object can be undefined.\n * In this case, you can use `ngIf` and store the result of the condition in a local\n * variable as shown in the the following example.\n *\n * {@example common/ngIf/ts/module.ts region='NgIfAs'}\n *\n * This code uses only one `AsyncPipe`, so only one subscription is created.\n * The conditional statement stores the result of `userStream|async` in the local variable `user`.\n * You can then bind the local `user` repeatedly.\n *\n * The conditional displays the data only if `userStream` returns a value,\n * so you don't need to use the\n * [safe-navigation-operator](guide/template-syntax#safe-navigation-operator) (`?.`)\n * to guard against null values when accessing properties.\n * You can display an alternative template while waiting for the data.\n *\n * ### Shorthand syntax\n *\n * The shorthand syntax `*ngIf` expands into two separate template specifications\n * for the \"then\" and \"else\" clauses. For example, consider the following shorthand statement,\n * that is meant to show a loading page while waiting for data to be loaded.\n *\n * ```\n * <div class=\"hero-list\" *ngIf=\"heroes else loading\">\n *  ...\n * </div>\n *\n * <ng-template #loading>\n *  <div>Loading...</div>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * You can see that the \"else\" clause references the `<ng-template>`\n * with the `#loading` label, and the template for the \"then\" clause\n * is provided as the content of the anchor element.\n *\n * However, when Angular expands the shorthand syntax, it creates\n * another `<ng-template>` tag, with `ngIf` and `ngIfElse` directives.\n * The anchor element containing the template for the \"then\" clause becomes\n * the content of this unlabeled `<ng-template>` tag.\n *\n * ```\n * <ng-template [ngIf]=\"heroes\" [ngIfElse]=\"loading\">\n *  <div class=\"hero-list\">\n *   ...\n *  </div>\n * </ng-template>\n *\n * <ng-template #loading>\n *  <div>Loading...</div>\n * </ng-template>\n * ```\n *\n * The presence of the implicit template object has implications for the nesting of\n * structural directives.

If no input observables are provided, resulting stream will complete\n * immediately.\n *\n * `forkJoin` will wait for all passed observables to complete and then it will emit an array or an object with last\n * values from corresponding observables.\n *\n * If you pass an array of `n` observables to the operator, resulting\n * array will have `n` values, where first value is the last thing emitted by the first observable,\n * second value is the last thing emitted by the second observable and so on.\n *\n * If you pass a dictionary of observables to the operator, resulting\n * objects will have the same keys as the dictionary passed, with their last values they've emitted\n * located at the corresponding key.\n *\n * That means `forkJoin` will not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined\n * values not only at the end of lifecycle of passed observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}\n * or {@link zip} instead.\n *\n * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input observables, whenever any of\n * that observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well\n * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other observables.\n * Conversely, if there is an observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,\n * unless at any point some other observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to\n * the previous case. Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all observables passed as arguments\n * have to emit something at least once and complete.\n *\n * If any input observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other observables\n * will be immediately unsubscribed.\n *\n * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally\n * would land in emitted array. Whatever is returned by project function, will appear in output\n * observable instead. This means that default project can be thought of as a function that takes\n * all its arguments and puts them into an array. Note that project function will be called only\n * when output observable is supposed to emit a result.\n *\n * ## Examples\n *\n * ### Use forkJoin with a dictionary of observable inputs\n * ```ts\n * import { forkJoin, of, timer } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const observable = forkJoin({\n *   foo: of(1, 2, 3, 4),\n *   bar: Promise.resolve(8),\n *   baz: timer(4000),\n * });\n * observable.subscribe({\n *  next: value => console.log(value),\n *  complete: () => console.log('This is how it ends!'),\n * });\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // { foo: 4, bar: 8, baz: 0 } after 4 seconds\n * // \"This is how it ends!\" immediately after\n * ```\n *\n * ### Use forkJoin with an array of observable inputs\n * ```ts\n * import { forkJoin, of } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const observable = forkJoin([\n *   of(1, 2, 3, 4),\n *   Promise.resolve(8),\n *   timer(4000),\n * ]);\n * observable.subscribe({\n *  next: value => console.log(value),\n *  complete: () => console.log('This is how it ends!'),\n * });\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // [4, 8, 0] after 4 seconds\n * // \"This is how it ends!\" immediately after\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link combineLatest}\n * @see {@link zip}\n *\n * @param {...ObservableInput} sources Any number of Observables provided either as an array or as an arguments\n * passed directly to the operator.\n * @param {function} [project] Function that takes values emitted by input Observables and returns value\n * that will appear in resulting Observable instead of default array.\n * @return {Observable} Observable emitting either an array of last values emitted by passed Observables\n * or value from project function.\n */\nexport function forkJoin(\n  ...sources: any[]\n): Observable<any> {\n  if (sources.length === 1) {\n    const first = sources[0];\n    if (isArray(first)) {\n      return forkJoinInternal(first, null);\n    }\n    // TODO(benlesh): isObservable check will not be necessary when deprecated path is removed.\n    if (isObject(first) && Object.getPrototypeOf(first) === Object.prototype) {\n      const keys = Object.keys(first);\n      return forkJoinInternal(keys.map(key => first[key]), keys);\n    }\n  }\n\n  // DEPRECATED PATHS BELOW HERE\n  if (typeof sources[sources.length - 1] === 'function') {\n    const resultSelector = sources.pop() as Function;\n    sources = (sources.length === 1 && isArray(sources[0])) ? sources[0] : sources;\n    return forkJoinInternal(sources, null).pipe(\n      map((args: any[]) => resultSelector(...args))\n    );\n  }\n\n  return forkJoinInternal(sources, null);\n}\n\nfunction forkJoinInternal(sources: ObservableInput<any>[], keys: string[] | null): Observable<any> {\n  return new Observable(subscriber => {\n    const len = sources.length;\n    if (len === 0) {\n      subscriber.complete();\n      return;\n    }\n    const values = new Array(len);\n    let completed = 0;\n    let emitted = 0;\n    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {\n      const source = from(sources[i]);\n      let hasValue = false;\n      subscriber.add(source.subscribe({\n        next: value => {\n          if (!hasValue) {\n            hasValue = true;\n            emitted++;\n          }\n          values[i] = value;\n        },\n        error: err => subscriber.error(err),\n        complete: () => {\n          completed++;\n          if (completed === len || !hasValue) {\n            if (emitted === len) {\n              subscriber.next(keys ?\n                keys.reduce((result, key, i) => (result[key] = values[i], result), {}) :\n                values);\n            }\n            subscriber.complete();\n          }\n        }\n      }));\n    }\n  });\n}\n","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.

It's possible for the identities of items\n * to change while the data does not. This can happen, for example, if the items are produced\n * from an RPC to the server, and that RPC is re-run. Even if the data hasn't changed, the\n * second response will produce objects with different identities.\n *\n * To customize the default option comparison algorithm, `<select>` supports `compareWith` input.\n * `compareWith` takes a **function** which has two arguments: `option1` and `option2`.\n * If `compareWith` is given, Angular selects option by the return value of the function.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const selectedCountriesControl = new FormControl();\n * ```\n *\n * ```\n * <select [compareWith]=\"compareFn\"  [formControl]=\"selectedCountriesControl\">\n *     <option *ngFor=\"let country of countries\" [ngValue]=\"country\">\n *         {{country.name}}\n *     </option>\n * </select>\n *\n * compareFn(c1: Country, c2: Country): boolean {\n *     return c1 && c2 ? c1.id === c2.id : c1 === c2;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * **Note:** We listen to the 'change' event because 'input' events aren't fired\n * for selects in Firefox and IE:\n * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1024350\n * https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/4660045/\n *\n * @ngModule ReactiveFormsModule\n * @ngModule FormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\n@Directive({\n  selector:\n      'select:not([multiple])[formControlName],select:not([multiple])[formControl],select:not([multiple])[ngModel]',\n  host: {'(change)': 'onChange($event.target.value)', '(blur)': 'onTouched()'},\n  providers: [SELECT_VALUE_ACCESSOR]\n})\nexport class SelectControlValueAccessor implements ControlValueAccessor {\n  value: any;\n  /** @internal */\n  _optionMap: Map<string, any> = new Map<string, any>();\n  /** @internal */\n  _idCounter: number = 0;\n\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * The registered callback function called when a change event occurs on the input element.\n   */\n  onChange = (_: any) => {};\n\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * The registered callback function called when a blur event occurs on the input element.\n   */\n  onTouched = () => {};\n\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * Tracks the option comparison algorithm for tracking identities when\n   * checking for changes.\n   */\n  @Input()\n  set compareWith(fn: (o1: any, o2: any) => boolean) {\n    if (typeof fn !== 'function') {\n      throw new Error(`compareWith must be a function, but received ${JSON.stringify(fn)}`);\n    }\n    this._compareWith = fn;\n  }\n\n  private _compareWith: (o1: any, o2: any) => boolean = looseIdentical;\n\n  constructor(private _renderer: Renderer2, private _elementRef: ElementRef) {}\n\n  /**\n   * Sets the \"value\" property on the input element.

First, developers have found this pattern\n * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's\n * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply\n * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value\n * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like\n * delaying updates with`ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,\n * which has understandably caused some confusion.\n *\n * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which\n * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of\n * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic\n * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in\n * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.\n *\n * To update your code before support is removed, you'll want to decide whether to stick\n * with reactive form directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or\n * switch over to template-driven directives.\n *\n * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <input [formControl]=\"control\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.control.setValue('some value');\n * ```\n *\n * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <input [(ngModel)]=\"value\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.value = 'some value';\n * ```\n *\n * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev\n * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for\n * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:\n *\n * ```ts\n * imports: [\n *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'});\n * ]\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this\n * pattern with a config value of `\"always\"`. This may help to track down where in the code\n * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.\n *\n * @ngModule ReactiveFormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\n@Directive({selector: '[formControl]', providers: [formControlBinding], exportAs: 'ngForm'})\n\nexport class FormControlDirective extends NgControl implements OnChanges {\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * Internal reference to the view model value.\n   */\n  viewModel: any;\n\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * Tracks the `FormControl` instance bound to the directive.\n   */\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  @Input('formControl') form !: FormControl;\n\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * Triggers a warning that this input should not be used with reactive forms.\n   */\n  @Input('disabled')\n  set isDisabled(isDisabled: boolean) { ReactiveErrors.disabledAttrWarning(); }\n\n  // TODO(kara): remove next 4 properties once deprecation period is over\n\n  /** @deprecated as of v6 */\n  @Input('ngModel') model: any;\n\n  /** @deprecated as of v6 */\n  @Output('ngModelChange') update = new EventEmitter();\n\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * Static property used to track whether any ngModel warnings have been sent across\n   * all instances of FormControlDirective.

First, developers have found this pattern\n * confusing. It seems like the actual `ngModel` directive is being used, but in fact it's\n * an input/output property named `ngModel` on the reactive form directive that simply\n * approximates (some of) its behavior. Specifically, it allows getting/setting the value\n * and intercepting value events. However, some of `ngModel`'s other features - like\n * delaying updates with `ngModelOptions` or exporting the directive - simply don't work,\n * which has understandably caused some confusion.\n *\n * In addition, this pattern mixes template-driven and reactive forms strategies, which\n * we generally don't recommend because it doesn't take advantage of the full benefits of\n * either strategy. Setting the value in the template violates the template-agnostic\n * principles behind reactive forms, whereas adding a `FormControl`/`FormGroup` layer in\n * the class removes the convenience of defining forms in the template.\n *\n * To update your code before support is removed, you'll want to decide whether to stick with\n * reactive form directives (and get/set values using reactive forms patterns) or switch over to\n * template-driven directives.\n *\n * After (choice 1 - use reactive forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <form [formGroup]=\"form\">\n *   <input formControlName=\"first\">\n * </form>\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.form.get('first').setValue('some value');\n * ```\n *\n * After (choice 2 - use template-driven forms):\n *\n * ```html\n * <input [(ngModel)]=\"value\">\n * ```\n *\n * ```ts\n * this.value = 'some value';\n * ```\n *\n * By default, when you use this pattern, you will see a deprecation warning once in dev\n * mode. You can choose to silence this warning by providing a config for\n * `ReactiveFormsModule` at import time:\n *\n * ```ts\n * imports: [\n *   ReactiveFormsModule.withConfig({warnOnNgModelWithFormControl: 'never'})\n * ]\n * ```\n *\n * Alternatively, you can choose to surface a separate warning for each instance of this\n * pattern with a config value of `\"always\"`. This may help to track down where in the code\n * the pattern is being used as the code is being updated.\n *\n * @ngModule ReactiveFormsModule\n * @publicApi\n */\n@Directive({selector: '[formControlName]', providers: [controlNameBinding]})\nexport class FormControlName extends NgControl implements OnChanges, OnDestroy {\n  private _added = false;\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * Internal reference to the view model value.\n   * @internal\n   */\n  viewModel: any;\n\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * Tracks the `FormControl` instance bound to the directive.\n   */\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  readonly control !: FormControl;\n\n  /**\n   * @description\n   * Tracks the name of the `FormControl` bound to the directive.

Combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are\n * calculated from the latest values of each of its input Observables.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it\n * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits\n * the output of that formula.</span>\n *\n * ![](combineLatest.png)\n *\n * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as\n * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all these values but the last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, if some Observable does not emit a value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Combine two timer Observables\n * ```ts\n * import { combineLatest, timer } from 'rxjs';\n *\n * const firstTimer = timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n * ```\n *\n * ### Combine an array of Observables\n * ```ts\n * import { combineLatest, of } from 'rxjs';\n * import { delay, starWith } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => of(n).pipe(\n *     delay(n * 1000),   // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n *     startWith(0),\n *   )\n * );\n * const combined = combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n * ```\n *\n *\n * ### Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index\n * ```ts\n * import { combineLatest, of } from 'rxjs';\n * import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const weight = of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);\n * const height = of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);\n * const bmi = combineLatest(weight, height).pipe(\n *   map(([w, h]) => w / (h * h)),\n * );\n * bmi.subscribe(x => console.log('BMI is ' + x));\n *\n * // With output to console:\n * // BMI is 24.212293388429753\n * // BMI is 23.93948099205209\n * // BMI is 23.671253629592222\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link merge}\n * @see {@link withLatestFrom}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable1 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * @param {ObservableInput} observable2 An input Observable to combine with other Observables.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as arguments\n * or an array of Observables may be given as the first argument.\n * @param {function} [project] An optional function to project the values from\n * the combined latest values into a new value on the output Observable.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=null] The {@link SchedulerLike} to use for subscribing to\n * each input Observable.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable of projected values from the most recent\n * values from each input Observable, or an array of the most recent values from\n * each input Observable.\n */\nexport function combineLatest<O extends ObservableInput<any>, R>(\n  ...observables: (O | ((...values: ObservedValueOf<O>[]) => R) | SchedulerLike)[]\n): Observable<R> {\n  let resultSelector: (...values: Array<any>) => R =  null;\n  let scheduler: SchedulerLike = null;\n\n  if (isScheduler(observables[observables.length - 1])) {\n    scheduler = observables.pop() as SchedulerLike;\n  }\n\n  if (typeof observables[observables.length - 1] === 'function') {\n    resultSelector = observables.pop() as (...values: Array<any>) => R;\n  }\n\n  // if the first and only other argument besides the resultSelector is an array\n  // assume it's been called with `combineLatest([obs1, obs2, obs3], resultSelector)`\n  if (observables.length === 1 && isArray(observables[0])) {\n    observables = observables[0] as any;\n  }\n\n  return fromArray(observables, scheduler).lift(new CombineLatestOperator<ObservedValueOf<O>, R>(resultSelector));\n}\n\nexport class CombineLatestOperator<T, R> implements Operator<T, R> {\n  constructor(private resultSelector?: (...values: Array<any>) => R) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<R>, source: any): any {\n    return source.subscribe(new CombineLatestSubscriber(subscriber, this.resultSelector));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nexport class CombineLatestSubscriber<T, R> extends OuterSubscriber<T, R> {\n  private active: number = 0;\n  private values: any[] = [];\n  private observables: any[] = [];\n  private toRespond: number;\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<R>, private resultSelector?: (...values: Array<any>) => R) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  protected _next(observable: any) {\n    this.values.push(NONE);\n    this.observables.push(observable);\n  }\n\n  protected _complete() {\n    const observables = this.observables;\n    const len = observables.length;\n    if (len === 0) {\n      this.destination.complete();\n    } else {\n      this.active = len;\n      this.toRespond = len;\n      for (let i = 0;

class=\"informal\">Concatenates multiple Observables together by\n * sequentially emitting their values, one Observable after the other.</span>\n *\n * ![](concat.png)\n *\n * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and\n * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of\n * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result\n * in Observable that completes immediately.\n *\n * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without\n * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will\n * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be\n * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,\n * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator\n * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out\n * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,\n * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.\n *\n * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete\n * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other\n * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be\n * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.\n *\n * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,\n * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after\n * the one that emitted error, never will.\n *\n * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values\n * will be \"replayed\" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable\n * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,\n * you can always use {@link repeat}.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10\n * ```ts\n * import { concat, interval, range } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer = interval(1000).pipe(take(4));\n * const sequence = range(1, 10);\n * const result = concat(timer, sequence);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in:\n * // 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> 2 -1000ms-> 3 -immediate-> 1 ... 10\n * ```\n *\n * ### Concatenate 3 Observables\n * ```ts\n * import { concat, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer1 = interval(1000).pipe(take(10));\n * const timer2 = interval(2000).pipe(take(6));\n * const timer3 = interval(500).pipe(take(10));\n *\n * const result = concat(timer1, timer2, timer3);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in the following:\n * // (Prints to console sequentially)\n * // -1000ms-> 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> ... 9\n * // -2000ms-> 0 -2000ms-> 1 -2000ms-> ... 5\n * // -500ms-> 0 -500ms-> 1 -500ms-> ... 9\n * ```\n *\n * ### Concatenate the same Observable to repeat it\n * ```ts\n * import { concat, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer = interval(1000).pipe(take(2));\n *\n * concat(timer, timer) // concatenating the same Observable!\n * .subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('...and it is done!')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0 after 1s\n * // 1 after 2s\n * // 0 after 3s\n * // 1 after 4s\n * // \"...and it is done!\" also after 4s\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link concatAll}\n * @see {@link concatMap}\n * @see {@link concatMapTo}\n * @see {@link startWith}\n * @see {@link endWith}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} input1 An input Observable to concatenate with others.\n * @param {ObservableInput} input2 An input Observable to concatenate with others.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as argument.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=null] An optional {@link SchedulerLike} to schedule each\n * Observable subscription on.\n * @return {Observable} All values of each passed Observable merged into a\n * single Observable, in order, in serial fashion.\n * @static true\n * @name concat\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function concat<O extends ObservableInput<any>, R>(...observables: Array<O | SchedulerLike>): Observable<ObservedValueOf<O> | R> {\n  return concatAll<R>()(of(...observables));\n}\n","import { Operator } from '../Operator';\nimport { Observable } from '../Observable';\nimport { Subscriber } from '../Subscriber';\nimport { OperatorFunction, MonoTypeOperatorFunction } from '../types';\n\n/* tslint:disable:max-line-length */\nexport function scan<T, R>(accumulator: (acc: R, value: T, index: number) => R, seed: R): OperatorFunction<T, R>;\nexport function scan<T>(accumulator: (acc: T, value: T, index: number) => T, seed?: T): MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T>;\nexport function scan<T, R>(accumulator: (acc: R, value: T, index: number) => R): OperatorFunction<T, R>;\n/* tslint:enable:max-line-length */\n\n/**\n * Applies an accumulator function over the source Observable, and returns each\n * intermediate result, with an optional seed value.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">It's like {@link reduce}, but emits the current\n * accumulation whenever the source emits a value.</span>\n *\n * ![](scan.png)\n *\n * Combines together all values emitted on the source, using an accumulator\n * function that knows how to join a new source value into the accumulation from\n * the past.

The 'Chat' component is placed into the 'aux' outlet.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team\n * }, {\n *   path: 'chat/:user',\n *   component: Chat\n *   outlet: 'aux'\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Wild Cards\n *\n * The following route uses wild-card notation to specify a component\n * that is always instantiated regardless of where you navigate to.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '**',\n *   component: WildcardComponent\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Redirects\n *\n * The following route uses the `redirectTo` property to ignore a segment of\n * a given URL when looking for a child path.\n *\n * When navigating to '/team/11/legacy/user/jim', the router changes the URL segment\n * '/team/11/legacy/user/jim' to '/team/11/user/jim', and then instantiates\n * the Team component with the User child component in it.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: 'legacy/user/:name',\n *     redirectTo: 'user/:name'\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * The redirect path can be relative, as shown in this example, or absolute.\n * If we change the `redirectTo` value in the example to the absolute URL segment '/user/:name',\n * the result URL is also absolute, '/user/jim'.\n\n * ### Empty Path\n *\n * Empty-path route configurations can be used to instantiate components that do not 'consume'\n * any URL segments.\n *\n * In the following configuration, when navigating to\n * `/team/11`, the router instantiates the 'AllUsers' component.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: AllUsers\n *   }, {\n *     path: 'user/:name',\n *     component: User\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * Empty-path routes can have children. In the following example, when navigating\n * to `/team/11/user/jim`, the router instantiates the wrapper component with\n * the user component in it.\n *\n * Note that an empty path route inherits its parent's parameters and data.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'team/:id',\n *   component: Team,\n *   children: [{\n *     path: '',\n *     component: WrapperCmp,\n *     children: [{\n *       path: 'user/:name',\n *       component: User\n *     }]\n *   }]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Matching Strategy\n *\n * The default path-match strategy is 'prefix', which means that the router\n * checks URL elements from the left to see if the URL matches a specified path.\n * For example, '/team/11/user' matches 'team/:id'.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'prefix', //default\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * You can specify the path-match strategy 'full' to make sure that the path\n * covers the whole unconsumed URL. It is important to do this when redirecting\n * empty-path routes. Otherwise, because an empty path is a prefix of any URL,\n * the router would apply the redirect even when navigating to the redirect destination,\n * creating an endless loop.\n *\n * In the following example, supplying the 'full' `pathMatch` strategy ensures\n * that the router applies the redirect if and only if navigating to '/'.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: '',\n *   pathMatch: 'full',\n *   redirectTo: 'main'\n * }, {\n *   path: 'main',\n *   component: Main\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Componentless Routes\n *\n * You can share parameters between sibling components.\n * For example, suppose that two sibling components should go next to each other,\n * and both of them require an ID parameter. You can accomplish this using a route\n * that does not specify a component at the top level.\n *\n * In the following example, 'MainChild' and 'AuxChild' are siblings.\n * When navigating to 'parent/10/(a//aux:b)', the route instantiates\n * the main child and aux child components next to each other.\n * For this to work, the application component must have the primary and aux outlets defined.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: 'a', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: 'b', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * The router merges the parameters, data, and resolve of the componentless\n * parent into the parameters, data, and resolve of the children.\n *\n * This is especially useful when child components are defined\n * with an empty path string, as in the following example.\n * With this configuration, navigating to '/parent/10' creates\n * the main child and aux components.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *    path: 'parent/:id',\n *    children: [\n *      { path: '', component: MainChild },\n *      { path: '', component: AuxChild, outlet: 'aux' }\n *    ]\n * }]\n * ```\n *\n * ### Lazy Loading\n *\n * Lazy loading speeds up application load time by splitting the application\n * into multiple bundles and loading them on demand.\n * To use lazy loading, provide the `loadChildren` property  instead of the `children` property.\n *\n * Given the following example route, the router will lazy load\n * the associated module on demand using the browser native import system.\n *\n * ```\n * [{\n *   path: 'lazy',\n *   loadChildren: () => import('./lazy-route/lazy.module').then(mod => mod.LazyModule),\n * }];\n * ```\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nexport interface Route {\n  /**\n   * The path to match against.

It's\n * used as follows:\n *\n * ```\n * <a [routerLink]=\"['/user/bob']\" [state]=\"{tracingId: 123}\">\n *   link to user component\n * </a>\n * ```\n *\n * And later the value can be read from the router through `router.getCurrentNavigation`.\n * For example, to capture the `tracingId` above during the `NavigationStart` event:\n *\n * ```\n * // Get NavigationStart events\n * router.events.pipe(filter(e => e instanceof NavigationStart)).subscribe(e => {\n *   const navigation = router.getCurrentNavigation();\n *   tracingService.trace({id: navigation.extras.state.tracingId});\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * The router link directive always treats the provided input as a delta to the current url.\n *\n * For instance, if the current url is `/user/(box//aux:team)`.\n *\n * Then the following link `<a [routerLink]=\"['/user/jim']\">Jim</a>` will generate the link\n * `/user/(jim//aux:team)`.\n *\n * See {@link Router#createUrlTree createUrlTree} for more information.\n *\n * @ngModule RouterModule\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\n@Directive({selector: ':not(a):not(area)[routerLink]'})\nexport class RouterLink {\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  @Input() queryParams !: {[k: string]: any};\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  @Input() fragment !: string;\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  @Input() queryParamsHandling !: QueryParamsHandling;\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  @Input() preserveFragment !: boolean;\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  @Input() skipLocationChange !: boolean;\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  @Input() replaceUrl !: boolean;\n  @Input() state?: {[k: string]: any};\n  private commands: any[] = [];\n  // TODO(issue/24571): remove '!'.\n  private preserve !: boolean;\n\n  constructor(\n      private router: Router, private route: ActivatedRoute,\n      @Attribute('tabindex') tabIndex: string, renderer: Renderer2, el: ElementRef) {\n    if (tabIndex == null) {\n      renderer.setAttribute(el.nativeElement, 'tabindex', '0');\n    }\n  }\n\n  @Input()\n  set routerLink(commands: any[]|string) {\n    if (commands != null) {\n      this.commands = Array.isArray(commands) ?
